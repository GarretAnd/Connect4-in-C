My first coding project ever for my ENGS20 Class at Dartmouth in the spring of 2019. Had to make a workable game of connect 4 in C!

Got a fairly good grade on it and wanted to show some expertise in C plus (not C++) how far I have come from this project half a year ago.

Remember to compile it! If you want it may just be easiest to copy the code and paste it here: https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c_compiler
